**Author:** Chiara Iurato  
**Course:** Software Engineering 2  
**Academic Year:** 2023/2024

## GOAL
This project aims to predict defective classes by analyzing the projects Bookkeeper and Zookeeper. Various classifiers and techniques are employed to achieve this goal.


## Methodological Considerations

Efforts are made to avoid the "Snoring" problem, ensuring data relevance and accuracy by focusing on recent and relevant project releases.

## Configuration
**Classifiers:** Random Forest, Naive Bayes, IBk  
**Metrics:** Recall, Precision, Kappa, AUC  
**Techniques:** Feature Selection (Best First bi-directional), Balancing (Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE), Sensitive Learning

## Result
The results can be viewed at the following link
